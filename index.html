            <img src="images/hawaii.jpg">
            <p>The state of Hawaii is a series of 137 islands in which only there are only 8 mian islands that are inhabited. It resides about 2,400 miles from 
            the mainland United States in the Pacific Ocean. Majority of the previous islands are now submerged in the ocean. From left to right you have 
            Ni'ihau, Kauai, Oahu, Moloka,i, Lanai, Kaho'olawe, Maui, and the island of Hawai'i. The most populated island host most tourism and 
            military instilations is Oahu. That is where I live.
